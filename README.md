Streaming Data:Templates & Utils
--------------------------------
This Repo contains a collection:
1. Sample Data Generators
2. Extension Functions
3. Helper Functions and more. 
Stuff I use for experimenting with different features of **Kafka**, **Flink**, **Clickhouse** and **Kotlin** libraries in the context of Event Streaming.

I use these templates and utilities for creating more concrete resources like Blob posts, Workshops and Trainings.
